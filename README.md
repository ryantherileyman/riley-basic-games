Current Project

"The Garden of Eating" - A classic clone of the "Snake" game.  In the Quick Game, move the snake around the field to eat apples and grow, but be careful not to run into the walls, or yourself!  In Story Mode, play the Adam's Revenge campaign, where you play as the snake from the Garden of Eating.  Adam is angry at you for tricking Eve into eating the apple from the forbidden tree, and has trapped you in his gambit!  Navigate through nine mazes of increasing difficulty to escape his clutches!

Version 2.0 added the Adam's Revenge campaign.

Version 1.1 added game options, support for full-screen mode, and minor enhancements.

Version 1.0 is the first release.  The basic game is playable, with music and sound effects.
