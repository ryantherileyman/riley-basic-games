Current Project

"The Garden of Eating" - A classic clone of the "Snake" game.  Move the snake around the field to eat apples and grow, but be careful not to run into the walls, or yourself!  Plans for phase 2 include a light story-based game play mode, where your snake must progress through levels of increasing difficulty.
